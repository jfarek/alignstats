ChangeLog

AlignStats v0.9 (4 Nov 2019)

- Default behavior for filtering read pair base overlap from coverage metrics
reverted to pre-v0.8 behavior (i.e. not activated by default). Use either `-M`
or `-O` for filtering read pair base overlaps.
- New option `-M` enables filtering of read pair base overlap from counting
towards coverage statistics, using MC (mate cigar) tags when available for
determining exact overlap spans.
- Option `-O` now enables filtering of read pair base overlap from counting
towards coverage statistics, using a simpler read start position-based method
that does not depend on the presence of MC tags but may be less accurate.
- Include coverage metrics for 60X, 70X, and 500X.

AlignStats v0.8 (8 Sep 2019)

- Default behavior now filters read pair base overlap from counting towards
coverage statistics.
- Option `-O` for disabling filtering of read pair base overlap from counting
towards coverage statistics.
- Option `-b` for setting minimum base quality to count towards coverage
statistics.
- Make tree node key and value types uint64_t to prevent integer overflow in
large samples.

AlignStats v0.7 (8 Mar 2019)

- Fix median coverage calculation.

AlignStats v0.6 (31 Jan 2019)

- Duplicate and CIGAR-based metrics now properly calculated as subsets of
aligned reads and bases.

AlignStats v0.5 (5 Sep 2018)

- Adjust some metric key names to improve clarity.
- Revert percentages to values from 0 to 100.

AlignStats v0.4 (14 Aug 2018)

- Fix off-by-one when measuring lengths of target regions.
- Add coverage report metrics for 15X coverage.

AlignStats v0.3 (23 May 2018)

- Report is now in JSON format.
- Added standard deviation metrics for aligned read length, insert size, and
coverage.

AlignStats v0.2 (15 Dec 2017)

- Output report is now in JSON format.
- Option `-P` for setting the number of HTSlib decompression threads to spawn.
- Metric key names have changed, (see docs/kvs_pairs.md).
- Metrics have been added for coverage and insert size standard deviation.
- NM tag is now used to count mismatches instead of MD tag.
- Fix how bases on target or buffer are counted.

AlignStats v0.1 (13 Jun 2017)

First public version.
